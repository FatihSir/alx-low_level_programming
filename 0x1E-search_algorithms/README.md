# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

![Cover Image](1.jpeg)

Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science and software development, enabling efficient retrieval of data from various data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, and graphs. These algorithms are crucial for applications ranging from simple data lookups to complex database queries and information retrieval systems. By understanding and implementing different searching techniques, developers can optimize performance and ensure quick access to data, which is vital for creating responsive and efficient applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of searching algorithms to help developers and learners master these fundamental concepts.

## Tasks

#### 0. Linear search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the [Linear search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)

- Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the first index where `value` is located
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if `array` is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 0-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        10, 1, 42, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, -1, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, linear_search(array, size, 3));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 42, linear_search(array, size, 42));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, linear_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ ./0-linear

#### 1. Binary search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the [Binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search)

- Prototype : `int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the index where `value` is located
- You can assume that `array` will be sorted in ascending order
- You can assume that `value` won’t appear more than once in `array`
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if `array` is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and - when you search a subarray) (See example)

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 1-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point

        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 2, binary_search(array, size, 2));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 5, binary_search(array, 5, 5));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, binary_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

#### 7. Jump search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Jump search algorithm

- Prototype : `int jump_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in array
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the first index where value is located
- You can assume that `array` will be sorted in ascending order
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if array is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- You have to use the square root of the size of the array as the jump step.
- You can use the `sqrt()` function included in `<math.h>` (don’t forget to compile with -lm)
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching for, you have to print this value (see example)

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

#### 9. Interpolation search

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the `Interpolation search algorithm`

- Prototype : `int interpolation_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And value is the `value` to search for
- Your function must return the first index where `value` is located
- You can assume that `array` will be sorted in ascending order
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if array is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- To determine the probe position, you can use : `size_t pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (value - array[low]))`
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to - print this value (see example below)

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 102-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point

 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, interpolation_search(array, size, 3));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 7, interpolation_search(array, size, 7));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, interpolation_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

#### 10. Exponential search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the `Exponential search algorithm`

- Prototype : `int exponential_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the first index where `value` is located
- You can assume that `array` will be sorted in ascending order
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if array is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- You have to use powers of 2 as exponential ranges to search in your array
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching for, you have to print this value (See example)
- Once you’ve found the good range, you need to use a binary search:
    - Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) you’re searching in (See example)

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 103-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**

    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 62, exponential_search(array, size, 62));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, exponential_search(array, size, 3));

#### Advanced binary search
You may have noticed that the basic binary search does not necessarily return the index of the first value in the array (if this value appears more than once in the array). In this exercise, you’ll have to solve this problem.

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers.

- Prototype : `int advanced_binary(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `arra`y is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the index where `value` is located
- You can assume that `array` will be sorted in ascending order
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if array is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- Every time you split the array, you have to print the new array (or subarray) you’re searching in (See example)
- You have to use recursion. You may only use one loop (`while`, `for`, `do while`, etc.) in order to print the array

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 104-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point

int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        0, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 8, advanced_binary(array, size, 8));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 5, advanced_binary(array, size, 5));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, advanced_binary(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
