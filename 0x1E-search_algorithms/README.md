# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

![Cover Image](1.PNG)

Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science and software development, enabling efficient retrieval of data from various data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, and graphs. These algorithms are crucial for applications ranging from simple data lookups to complex database queries and information retrieval systems. By understanding and implementing different searching techniques, developers can optimize performance and ensure quick access to data, which is vital for creating responsive and efficient applications. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of searching algorithms to help developers and learners master these fundamental concepts.

## Tasks

#### 0. Linear search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the [Linear search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)

- Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
- `size` is the number of elements in `array`
- And `value` is the value to search for
- Your function must return the first index where `value` is located
- If `value` is not present in `array` or if `array` is `NULL`, your function must return `-1`
- Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)

```c
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 0-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {
        10, 1, 42, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, -1, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, linear_search(array, size, 3));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 42, linear_search(array, size, 42));
    printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, linear_search(array, size, 999));
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
