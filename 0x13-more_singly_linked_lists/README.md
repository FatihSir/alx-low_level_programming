More singly linked lists

The main aim is to practice using singly linked lists on various tasks , Therefore this file will consist of

1 - 0-print_listint.c
In this task a function to print the elements of a list (listint_t) has been implemented
you should look at lists.h to see how listint_t looks like

2 - 1-listint_len.c
In this task just like the previous task but this time just returning the number of the nodes within the list
without printing the elements inside each node
