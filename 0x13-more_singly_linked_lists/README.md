More singly linked lists

The main aim is to practice using singly linked lists on various tasks , Therefore this file will consist of

1 - 0-print_listint.c
In this task a function to print the elements of a list (listint_t) has been implemented
you should look at lists.h to see how listint_t looks like

2 - 1-listint_len.c
In this task just like the previous task but this time just returning the number of the nodes within the list
without printing the elements inside each node 
3 - 2-add_nodeint.c
The aim of this task is to create a new node in the beginning which we have to let the head points to it and it should point
to the node that head was pointing to.
3 - 3-add_nodeint_end.c
The aim of this task is to create a new node at the last of the list which needs to iterate over the list and find the last
node node and then letting it to point to the new node after creating it .Finally the new node will point to NULL as it became
the last node at the list.
